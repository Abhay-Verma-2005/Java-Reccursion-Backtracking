# Java Recursion & Backtracking

## âœ¨ Overview
This project explains **Recursion and Backtracking** in Java in a simple way. These techniques help solve tricky problems by breaking them into smaller, easier parts.

## ðŸ“– What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem. Itâ€™s useful for:
- Finding Factorials
- Generating Fibonacci Series
- Solving the Tower of Hanoi
- Searching and Sorting data

## ðŸŽ¨ What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a way to find solutions by trying different options and going back if they donâ€™t work. Itâ€™s used in:
- Solving Mazes
- Placing N-Queens on a Chessboard
- Completing Sudoku Puzzles
- Generating Subsets and Permutations

## âš¡ Features
- **Easy-to-understand Java code** for recursion and backtracking.
- **Clear explanations** for each problem.
- **Step-by-step solutions** to help you learn better.
- **Real-life examples** to show these techniques in action.

## ðŸ›  What You Need to Know
- Basics of Java programming
- How function calls and stacks work

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Adding more advanced backtracking problems
- Making the code run even faster
- Creating visual guides for better understanding
