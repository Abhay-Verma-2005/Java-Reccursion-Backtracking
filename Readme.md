# Java Recursion & Backtracking

## ✨ Overview
This project covers **Recursion and Backtracking** in Java, essential techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

## 📖 What is Recursion?
Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It helps in solving problems like:
- Factorial Calculation
- Fibonacci Series
- Tower of Hanoi
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## 🎨 What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used to find all (or some) solutions by exploring possibilities and undoing steps when necessary. It is commonly used for:
- Maze Solving
- N-Queens Problem
- Sudoku Solver
- Subset and Permutation Generation

## ⚡ Features
- **Java Implementations** of recursion and backtracking.
- **Optimized Code** with explanations.
- **Step-by-Step Execution** to understand problem-solving better.
- **Real-Life Examples** to see recursion and backtracking in action.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java
- Understanding of function calls and stacks

## 🌍 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-recursion-backtracking.git
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Run the Java files to test recursion and backtracking examples.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- More complex backtracking problems
- Performance optimization techniques
- Interactive visualization for better learning
